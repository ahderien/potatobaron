            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            
            <p>You can get order just about anything off the internet.  Shoes, toys, coffee makers, pizza...</p>
            <p>There's no question that technology has changed the way we looka at the world.  It used to be that if you wanted shoes, you had to go into the store.  If you wanted a pizza delivered to your door, you had to actually use your phone as your phone instead of as a way to look up the best place order pizza from.</p>
            <p>
                In 2010, our founder Zifan Guo, was looking around at the world, and he realized that although you could even have your groceries delivered directly to your door, there was no one who would deliver a baked potato, hot and ready with plenty of bacon and sour cream.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Having realized this void, he set out to find like-minded people who understood his vision, and Potato Baron was founded.
